Given an array A[] of n-elements. We need to select two adjacent elements and delete the larger of them and store smaller of them to another array say B[]. We need to perform this operation till array A[] contains only single element. Finally, we have to construct the array B[] in such a way that total sum of its element is minimum. Print the total sum of array B[].
Examples: 
 

Input : A[] = {3, 4} 
Output : 3

Input : A[] = {2, 4, 1, 3}
Output : 3
